Website Rationale: Funky Farm Retro Chairs
This platform, known as "Funky Chairs," is dedicated to showcasing an eclectic array of retro chairs tailored for a discerning older demographic aged 55-90, who possess a penchant for vintage charm and fine craftsmanship. The website endeavours to captivate their interest and rekindle their admiration for these enduring design pieces.

Design Decisions and User Experience (UX) Principles
The website's design is underpinned by several strategic decisions aimed at enhancing user experience and fostering engagement:

Retro-Inspired Colour Palette: A thoughtfully curated colour scheme featuring bold and vibrant hues such as fiery red (#FF5252), sunny yellow (#FFD740), rich purple (#7B1FA2), playful pink (#FF4081), tranquil light blue (#64B5F6), and invigorating teal (#00BFA5), evokes a strong sense of nostalgia and complements the lively chair designs.

Typography: The branding prominently features the robust Roboto font in dynamic, multi-coloured variations throughout the site, establishing a distinct and impactful visual identity. Additionally, the slogan "Sit back and get funky!" is rendered in the whimsical Kaushan Script font, reinforcing the retro aesthetic and injecting a playful tone.

Interactive Carousel and Artist Profiles
The home page features a prominent carousel that automatically rotates images of four iconic chairs: "Embryo," "Sacco," "582," and "Globe." This engaging element keeps users interested and encourages them to explore each chair in detail. Manual controls allow users to browse at their own pace, fostering a sense of interactivity.
Additionally, four circular artist profiles displayed on the Artist page provide a glimpse into the creators behind the chairs. Clicking on a profile leads users to a page with further information and links to the artist's portfolio, showcasing the work of industrial designers, sculptors, and architects who have all contributed to this collection of unique seating.

Challenges, Solutions, Learnings, and Improvements
The development process presented its own set of hurdles, including a lack of initial enthusiasm and technical difficulties with coding. However, perseverance and a willingness to learn proved to be valuable tools. Utilising Glitch as the primary website builder streamlined the process, while YouTube tutorials offered instrumental guidance in overcoming specific coding challenges, such as creating smooth image transitions in the carousel.

While website building may not have been my initial area of interest, this project fostered a newfound appreciation for the complexities involved in web development. Refining skills in creative colour and font selection proved to be a rewarding aspect of the project. The experience also changed my perspective on website building, emphasising the importance of creating an engaging user experience that resonates with the target audience. 

Reflection on Prototypes and Conclusion
Comparing the initial prototype to the final website reveals a significant evolution in design. The minimalist approach of the prototype, which focused primarily on showcasing the chairs, gave way to a more dynamic and visually engaging website. This shift reflects a growing understanding of how to effectively showcase the unique charm of the retro chairs through vibrancy, interactivity, and artist profiles.

In conclusion, the Funky Chairs website project provided valuable insights into website development processes and the importance of user-centred design principles. By incorporating interactive elements, overcoming technical challenges, and embracing a retro aesthetic, the project contributed to skill refinement and a deeper appreciation for the nuances of web design.
